# updated-portfolio
This project is an updated portfolio which displays some information about me, as well as links to my GitHub profile, my LinkedIn profile, and a pdf of my resume. It also displays some projects which I feel show off my web development abilities particularly well. I've added one gif for project one, as well as screenshots for the other assignments that were completed. I based this portfolio on my previous one and used the same template, but made it more interactive as well as visually appealing.

I had a better linkedin image orginally, however, I had to change it based on it was throwing an error and would not display the image. I will work on getting a nicer one.
